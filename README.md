# ClimedoArtMuseum

This Project contains two main components and a service to communicate with backend,

### Art Overview Component :
This is my landing page where we are,
- Fetching all departments 
- Creating carousel views for different departments
- Virtual Scroll implemented to avoid heavy load on screen

### Carousel View component
This is a reused component for each of the departments we perform,
- Display of arts per department in carousel slider view
- On click of Art details showing a modal with further details
- Lazy load of images (load further only on next slide click)
- Dynamic number of images shown depending on screen size

## How to start Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
